# Car Rental Mobile Application

## Overview

The idea was to design a mobile application that allows the community to collaborate in car renting, or, in other words, a platform to rent cars put by the community for the community. Moreover, any user is able to rent a car or put up their own cars for rent. This way, users act as customers for the car they rent and hosts for their own uploaded cars being rented out to others. Users can register, log in, browse cars, make bookings, and manage their profiles. In addition, if the user wants to become a host, they can list their cars, manage bookings, and receive notifications about rental requests. The application integrates Firebase for authentication and uses notifications to keep users informed.

## Usage

- **User Registration and Login:** Create an account or log in using the registration and login screens.
- **Browsing Cars:** Use the car browsing screen to view available cars. Utilize the search box and filters to find specific cars.
- **Booking:** Make a booking request and wait for host confirmation. Check your booking history for details.
- **Notifications:** Stay updated with notifications about booking confirmations and new requests.
- **Host Management:** As a host, add, edit, or delete car listings. Manage booking requests and view your cars on the platform.
